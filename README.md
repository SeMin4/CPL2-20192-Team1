## Team1 - Project Management Dashboard

### What we do?

Making a dashboard for the management of projects which is alraedy completed and which all are in the progress to be shown lsit wise so that we can easily access any project information by just clicking at the tittle showing on the list on the homepage with some additional features like profile, calendar, checklist, notification and much more. 

### Why?

We are doing this for the easy access of all the projects and to keep a record of all projects like in every company there are n numbers of projects going on and maintaing all of them is a difficult task. So with the help of this anyone can keep a record of all projects and will be notified everytime so that they won't miss any deadline.
